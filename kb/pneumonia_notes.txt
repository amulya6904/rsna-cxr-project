PNEUMONIA (CXR) - QUICK NOTES

Common CXR patterns:
- Lobar consolidation: focal airspace opacity, often with air bronchograms.
- Bronchopneumonia: patchy, multifocal opacities.
- Interstitial pattern: diffuse reticular/ground-glass (can overlap with viral causes).

Clinical correlation:
- Consider fever, cough, SpO2 drop, tachypnea.
- Normal CXR does not fully exclude early infection.

Suggested next steps (general):
- Correlate with symptoms and vitals.
- If clinically suspected: consider antibiotics as per protocol and follow-up imaging.
- Consider alternate diagnoses (atelectasis, edema) if pattern not typical.
